# Missile Defence

This repository contains a set of simulations and relevant visualisations which illustrate some of the basic
concepts and assumptions underlying ballistic missile defence (BMD). The goal is not to provide mathematically
accurate models of the ways BMD systems operate, but to provide some intuition behind the theories and assumptions
underlying missile defence. Topics covered include:

* Terminal defence
* Layered defence
* Intercept probabilities
* Target survivability
